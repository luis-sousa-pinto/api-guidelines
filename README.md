# Microsoft REST API Guidelines
The [Sonae MC REST API Guidelines](Guidelines.md) are Sonae MC's internal company-wide REST API design guidelines.
Teams at Sonae MC typically reference this document when setting API design policy.
They may additionally create documents specific to their team, adding further guidance or making adjustments as appropriate to their circumstances.

We publish these guidelines here with the aim of fostering dialogue and learning in the API community at large.
We further hope that these guidelines may encourage other organizations to create guidelines that are appropriate for them and in turn, if they are able, to publish theirs.
